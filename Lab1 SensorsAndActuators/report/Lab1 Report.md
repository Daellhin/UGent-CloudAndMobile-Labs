> Hint: Notice the difference between what you had to do to get going with each piece of hardware. List some positives and negatives of each.

Raspberry Pi is a full computer and thus requiers a complicated operating system which needs to be installed and updated. The ESP32 is only a microcontroller and is more simplified, code can be uploaded to the microcontroller and can be executed directly. The raspberry being a full computer has the functionality to execute multiple things at once, we can access it via SSH and from there program it all concurrently. So the main advantages/disadvantages are around complexity(RPi is more complex then ESP32) and versatility(RPi can execute more programs, is full blown computer)
